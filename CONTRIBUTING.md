## Coding Standards

### Code Style

- Follow the official Go style guide
- Use `go fmt` to format your code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear and concise comments
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Aim for >90% test coverage
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Documentation

- Document all exported functions, types, and variables
- Use godoc format for documentation
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Update README.md for significant changes

### Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly
- Use error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf("message: %w", err)`
- Define custom error types for specific conditions
- Document error conditions in function comments
